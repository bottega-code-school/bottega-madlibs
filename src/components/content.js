              Ladies and gentlemen, this is <b>{data.color}</b> Barber, your sportscaster, bringing you the last inning of the game between the Cleveland <b>{data.pluralNoun}</b> and the <b>{data.adjectiveOne}</b> Yankees. <b>{data.celebOne}</b> is pitching for the Yankees. Here's the pitch! It's a low <b>{data.adjectiveTwo}</b> ball that just cuts the inside of the <b>{data.nounOne}</b> for a strike. That makes the count <b>{data.numberOne}</b> strikes and <b>{data.numberTwo}</b> balls. Now here's the next pitch. The batter swings and connects. It's a long, high <b>{data.nounTwo}</b> out to <b>{data.adjectiveThree}</b> field. But <b>{data.celebTwo}</b> is coming up fast and has it for the second out. The next batter up is <b>{data.celebThree}</b>, the Cleveland <b>{data.adjectiveFour}</b>-stop. Here's the pitch... and it's hit... a short ground ball to third <b>{data.nounThree}</b>. <b>{data.celebFour}</b> scoops it up and throws it to first base for an out, and the game is over. And the Yankees move into second place in the <b>{data.adjectiveFive}</b> League!
